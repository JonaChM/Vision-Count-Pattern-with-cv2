# Vision-Count-Pattern-with-cv2
Simple pattern detection on an image that shows you the commonly recognized object on an image along with a label over it.
This is not my first Python project but it is my first one that I upload to github.
This project was part of my learning journey for the machine learning career path and was teach by Aman Kharwal.
You can have the original code and explanation by going to: https://thecleverprogrammer.com/2021/05/11/count-objects-in-image-using-python/
On the imread method you have to set the path to the image that you want to analize, I change the code to make a raw path to the image.
Also on the last line I tried to create a print with the more generic explanation possible but its limited to certain elements that are on the database of detect_common_objects method.
I tried with some things like people and cars as per the tutorial and it worked fine and also I tried with fish on a tank but it return 1 cake, it was fun though.
